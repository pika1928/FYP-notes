# FYP-notes
Notes for my undergraduate Final Year Project "EV Motor Control with Free-RTOS on an Embedded CPU". 

This collection of notes is made using the note-taking app [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/).
They are all plain text markdown, however they are best viewed when opened as a "vault" in Obsidian.
