## [[FreeRTOS]] [[FOC]]
Plan is to implement FOC using only FreeRTOS [[HAL]] functions so that it will be portable to any other FreeRTOS-supporting MCU.

## [[DMA]] 
Need to look into DMA HAL functions in FreeRTOS, 
the [[STM32]] HAL DMA functions look ideal for streaming data from the 3 [[ADC]]s (reading the currents on each of the 3 motor phases) into memory.
