## [[ESC]] PCB schematic finished
Added CAN connector & circuitry, and encoder connector. 
STM32 pinout altered to group CAN Tx/Rx with SHDN pin (moved I2C1 pins, switched from stm32 CAN1 to CAN2) [[ESC#STM32 pinout]]. 
MCU PSU altered to source from USB if battery power absent [[ESC#Low Drop-Out regulator from USB power]].

Still to do is:
picking some components (MOSFETs, feedback resistors, misc. passives)
assigning footprints and other BOM fields
DRC/ERC (Design/Electrical Rule Check)
