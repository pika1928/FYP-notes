# ESC
# Electronic Speed Controller
A device that controls the speed of an electric motor.

In a motor control system, the ESC sits between the DC power source and the electric motor. It generates and controls the signals sent to the motor in order to achieve a desired speed as specified by the user/another system. 

# FYP Model-scale ESC
Where "model scale" means targeting up to 60V 100A, i.e. 6kW.

## Block diagram
The block diagram for a model scale might looks something like this:

The FOC program that such an ESC would run is detailed in [[FOC#Implementation]]:

### Power source
#### MCU
##### 3.3V
LM5008A switching buck regulator integrated inside [[DRV8353RS]] gate driver.
Recommended: a 10-47uF bulk capacitor near the input. 

##### LM5008A Component Values using datasheet 
Assuming:
	12-75V input voltage range. 
	150mA output current. 

###### R_FB1 & R_FB2
Vout=2.5*(RFB1+RFB2)/RFB1;
	therefore, for 3.3V out, ==RFB1:RFB2 must be 3.125:1==
###### R_T
Fmax = Vout/(Vinmax\*400ns)
		 = 3.3/(75\*400n) 
		 = 110kHz
RT = Vout/(1.385e-10\*Fmax)
	 = 3.3/(1.385e-10\*110k) 
	 = 216kOhm
Nearest E12 = ==220kOhm==, giving ==Fmax=108kHz==, ==Vinmax=76.1V==
###### L1

###### C3

###### C2 & R3

R3 must be sized so that with the ESR of C2 there results a >25mVp-p ripple at the FB pin. Typically this means 0.5-3Ohms.

###### R_CL

###### D1

###### C1

###### C4

###### C5

##### LM5008A Component Values using WEBENCH
Assuming:
	12-75V input voltage range. 
	3.3V @ 150mA output current. 
	30Â°C ambient temp. 

WEBENCH generates:

And simulates the output voltage for load currents of 50mA (sim:3) and 150mA (sim:4):
![[esc-WEBENCH-Vout-50-150mA.png]]
For which both ripple ~35mA between 3.283V and 3.317V. 

##### 3.3VA
Additional filtering for the analogue voltage source. 


#### FETs
large input lead capacitor
trace copper weight (trace tinning?)

### IO

## PCB Signal Integrity considerations
<u>Minimising signal-loop (return path) area</u>
Stack-up:    Signal - GND - GND - Signal
GND between signal layers reduces coupling fields & therefore crosstalk.
Adjacent GND vias by signal vias to provide minimal signal-loop area. 

Power layers close to HF ICs to minimise parasitic inductance (aka better opwer delivery).
Stich equi-potential layers (ie GND layers) together often.
